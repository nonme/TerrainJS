# TerrainJS

## Quickstart

`git clone https://github.com/nonme/TerrainJS.git
`npm install`
`npm start`

Note: The default browser that opens is Chrome. If you don't have Chrome or wish to change the opened browser, change the start script in package.json. More details on [this webpack-cli thread](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli/issues/2001).

`"start": "webpack serve --config webpack/base.js --open <your-preferred-browser.exe>"`

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via `npm`.
